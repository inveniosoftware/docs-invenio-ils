# Fast and responsive user interface

InvenioILS offers an efficient interface designed to meet the needs of both librarians and users.

## Literature requests

Users can easily request new literature (if not available in the catalogue), submit their requests online, and track the status of these requests. The process is streamlined to ensure that users can find and request the materials they need without hassle. Browse our catalog on-line, request loan and pick it up in the library when your order is ready.

## Self-Service features

Patrons are empowered to manage their own accounts, allowing them to request loan renewals and access their borrowing history without needing assistance from the librarians. This feature provides convenience to patrons and reduces the tasks at hand for the librarians.
