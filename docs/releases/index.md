# Releases

## Release cycles

We follow the principles of semantic versioning for all InvenioILS releases. New versions are released on an ad-hoc basis, once development is complete and the code is ready for deployment.


Starting with version 5, each release is production-grade ready. 

Our aim is to ensure that users of InvenioILS follow our latest releases by making the upgrade process a seamless experience.
